#' Aggregate the intensities and select median mz for features with identical rt.

#' @description This functions computes median mz and sum of intensities over features with same rt.

#' @return returns a tibble with the following columns
#' \itemize{
#'   \item mz - m/z ratio
#'   \item rt - retention time
#'   \item intensities - signal strength
#' }
